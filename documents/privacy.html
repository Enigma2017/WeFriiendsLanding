                      Welcome to WeFriiends</p>
                <p>
                    Welcome to our privacy policy! We&#39;d recommend you read it in full so you know exactly what we do with data here
                    Without some details about you, like basic profile and the sorts of individuals you'd like to meet, we won't be able to assist you in
                    making significant connections. We may also collect information created by your use of our services, in the form of access logs, as well 
                    as details from third parties, like when you use a social media account to access our services. We go into further depth below about the information that we may collect.
                </p>
                <h2>Information You Choose to Give Us</h2>
                <p>You may choose to give us certain information when using our services. This includes:</p>
                <ul>
                   <li>When you create an account on our Service, you provide us your login credentials as well as some basic information about yourself that is required for the service to
                     function, such as your gender and date of birth.</li>
                    <li>When you have finished your profile, you may add more information about yourself, like your personality, choice of lifestyle, interests, and other personal
                         information, as well as multimedia like images and videos. You may need to provide us access to your camera or photo album to contribute particular content, such as images or videos. </li>
                    <li>Some of the information you choose to tell us, such as your racial or ethnic origins, sexual orientation, and religious views, may be deemed "special" or "sensitive" in certain countries.
                         You consent to our processing of this information if you choose to supply it. </li>
                    <li>When you supply us or our payment service provider with information like your debit or credit card number or other financial information in the event that you subscribe to a paid service
                         or make a purchase directly from us (rather than just through a mobile platform such as iOS or Android).</li>
                    <li>When you engage in surveys or focus groups, you provide us with information on our goods and services, as well as replies to our questions and testimonials.</li>
                    <li>We gather the information you provide us throughout the conversation whenever you contact our customer service staff. We occasionally monitor or record these exchanges for training reasons
                         and to guarantee excellent service quality. </li>
                    <li>If in the event you ask us to communicate with or to handle the information of others (for example, in the event that you may ask us to send an email on your behalf to one of your friends),
                         we may collect the information about others that you provide us to fulfill your request. </li>
                    <li>Of course, as part of the service's operation, we also handle your discussions with other users and the information you upload.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Social networking sites.</h3>
                <p>
                    You may be able to create and log into your WeFriiends account using your social network login (for example, Facebook Login). This allows you to share information your from your social network
                     account with us without having to input your login name and password.

                <h3>Information We Get When You Use Our Services</h3>

                <h3>Usage Information.</h3>
                <p>
                    We may collect the information about your activity on our services, like as how you use them (like the date and time you logged in, the features you've been using, the searches, clicks,
                     and the pages shown to you, the referring web page address, the advertising resource that you clicked on) and how you have interacted with other users ( or the users you connect and interact with,
                      the time and date of your exchanges, number of messages you send and receive).
                </p>

                    <li>hardware and software information: These information are your IP address, device-specific and apps settings and characteristics, app crashes, advertising IDs (like Google's AAID and Apple's
                         IDFA, which are both randomly generated values that you can reset through your device' settings), device ID and type, the browser type you are using, version and language, operating system 
                         of your device, time zones, other virtual identifiers used by cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify your device or browser (like IMEI/UDID and MAC address); </li>

                <h3>Other information with your consent.</h3>
                <p>
                    If you give us permission, we can gather your precise geolocation (latitude and longitude) via a variety of methods, depending on the service and device you're using, such as GPS, Bluetooth,
                     or Wi-Fi connections. If the authorization you granted us in your device settings specifically enables such collection, we may gather your geolocation in the background even when you aren't
                      using the services. We will not gather your geolocation if you refuse to give us permission to do so. Similarly, with your permission, we may gather images and videos (for instance, if you
                       want to publish a photo, video, or conduct streaming on the services).
                </p>
                <h3>Information Collected by Cookies and Other Technologies.</h3>
                <p>
                    Like most online services and mobile applications, we may use cookies and other technologies, such as web beacons, web storage, and unique advertising identifiers, to collect information about
                     your activity, browser, and device. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually remove or reject browser cookies through the settings on your browser
                      or device. Keep in mind, though, that removing or rejecting cookies could affect the availability and functionality of our services.
