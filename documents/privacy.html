            <p style="text-indent: 45px;">
                Welcome to our privacy policy! We’d recommend you read it in full so you know exactly what we do with data here
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 45px;">
                Without some details about you, like basic profile and the sorts of individuals you'd like to meet, we won't be 
                able to assist you in making significant connections. We may also collect information created by your use of our services, 
                in the form of access logs, as well as details from third parties, like when you use a social media account to access our services.
                 We go into further depth below about the information that we may collect.
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-center">Information You Choose to Give Us</h3>
            <p style="text-indent: 45px;">

                - When you create an account on our Service, you provide us your login credentials as well as some basic information about 
                yourself that is required for the service to function, such as your gender and date of birth. <br>
                - When you have finished your profile, you may add more information about yourself, like your personality, choice of lifestyle, 
                interests, and other personal information, as well as multimedia like images and videos. You may need to provide us access to your
                 camera or photo album to contribute particular content, such as images or videos.<br>
                - Some of the information you choose to tell us, such as your racial or ethnic origins, sexual orientation, and religious views, may 
                be deemed "special" or "sensitive" in certain countries. You consent to our processing of this information if you choose to supply it.<br>
                - When you supply us or our payment service provider with information like your debit or credit card number or other financial information
                 in the event that you subscribe to a paid service or make a purchase directly from us (rather than just through a mobile platform such as 
                 iOS or Android).<br>
                - When you engage in surveys or focus groups, you provide us with information on our goods and services, as well as replies to our questions 
                and testimonials.<br>

                or record these exchanges for training reasons and to guarantee excellent service quality.<br>
                - If in the event you ask us to communicate with or to handle the information of others (for example, in the event that you may ask us to send 
                an email on your behalf to one of your friends), we may collect the information about others that you provide us to fulfill your request.<br>
                - Of course, as part of the service's operation, we also handle your discussions with other users and the information you upload.
