                    The WeFriiends App lets you create, upload, post, send, receive, and store images (such as your profile photo). When you do that, you retain whatever ownership rights in that content you had to begin with. But you grant us a license to use that content.

                    developing, providing, promoting, and improving the Service and researching and developing new ones. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can end these licenses anytime by deleting your content or account. However, the content will continue to appear if you shared it with others and they have not deleted it.
